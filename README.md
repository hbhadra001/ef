Hi — just catching up on this now, thanks for raising it. We’ve already built large-file and high-volume considerations into the self-service platform, including lessons learned from the Cash team’s earlier challenges. The portal captures file size, volume, and viscosity up front, and we enforce thresholds, chunking guidance, and routing to avoid processing backups. I’ve also developed a Lambda-based large-file transfer solution, and we have the option to leverage our own EF-made SFTP server if customers need support for extremely large file sizes. Happy to walk through the details offline.
