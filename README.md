# 🔧 **Business Value Proposition Slide (Architectural Version)**

### **Slide Title:**

**Architectural Value & Business Impact**

### **Business Value**

* **Standardization Across the Enterprise**
  A unified intake model ensures every customer and workflow complies with naming conventions, IAM policies, and architecture standards.

* **Operational Efficiency**
  Automating intake → validation → provisioning reduces engineering involvement by **50–70%**, freeing time for higher-value work.

* **Risk Reduction**
  Removes Excel-driven inconsistencies and prevents misconfigurations that could cause data loss, incorrect routing, or security issues.

* **Cost Optimization**
  Automation minimizes manual provisioning and avoids costly rework cycles caused by human error.

* **Visibility & Transparency**
  Customers can track onboarding progress, reducing slack/Teams/email interruptions across support teams.

### **Architectural Value**

* **Schema-driven configuration** ensures correct and compliant provisioning every time.
* **Step Functions + Terraform automation** provide predictable, repeatable deployments.
* **Centralized logging & audit trail** ensure compliance across regions and accounts.
* **Extensible platform** to support future workflows, AI assistance, and lifecycle management.
