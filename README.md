### **Teams Message (Final Draft)**

Hi everyone — I’ve completed the full presentation for our upcoming ARC Review. The deck follows the official ARC review template and includes all required sections (Executive Summary, Architecture Overview, Journey Slide, Security, DR, Cost Comparison, Decision Matrix, and Tech Stack rationale).

When you get a moment, could you please review and share any feedback or areas to refine? I want to make sure we’re aligned before the formal review.

Thank you!

If you want, I can also write:

📌 A **more formal version**
📌 A **shorter version**
📌 A **version mentioning the file location / link**

Just tell me!
